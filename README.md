For this program, we were given some ideas for how to start as well as the base code for generating graphics. Aside from that, all code is my own.

What does this program do?

When running this code, it will open a game in which a user can produce certain elements and watch how these elements interact with each other as they would in the real world. I used an abstract class call Element to define what an elemnent is and how it will intereract with its environment. I then created subclasses that implemented the guidelines of the Element class.
